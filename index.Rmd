Code and data for R workshop at KMUTT Bangkutien

# Compositional covariates and model averaging

This part of the workshop is driven by the issues raised in Cade (2015). Supplemental code adapted from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3307941.v1

Cade, B. S.  2015.  Model averaging and muddled multimodel inferences.  Ecology.

# Spatial autocorrelation

We might find the fortran code here: http://esapubs.org/archive/mono/M075/017/suppl-1.htm
to be useful. Generates data with spatial autocorrelation of particular types.

Here are the links to the handouts:

- [What is multicollinearity](multicollinearity.html)
- [What does multicollinearity do to model averaging](model_averaging.html)
- [What to do about compositional covariates](compositional_covariates.html)

Here are the "demo files" of R code from each of our sessions:

- [Wednesday](R/demo_wed.R)
- [Thursday](R/demo_thursday.R)
