```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The problem with compositional covariates is that they create multi-collinearity. We'll simulate the dataset created by Brian Cade to illustrate the problem and explore the different possible fixes.

```{r}
set.seed(680847638) # doesn't matter what this is -- if you use a different number your results will be different from mine.

```
